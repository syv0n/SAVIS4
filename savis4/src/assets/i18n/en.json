    "about_project": "Statistical Analysis Visualization for Introductory Statistics (SAVIS) is an educational tool developed through a research collaboration on statistical education between the Department of Mathematics at Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY) and California State University, Sacramento (CSUS). SAVIS helps students intuitively understand statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression using visualizations based on resampling and randomization techniques. This website provides an online and a stand-alone version (both freely available) in English and Spanish.",
    "about_created": "SAVIS was developed in Spring 2019 and extended in Spring 2020, 2024, and 2025 by teams of graduating seniors from CSUS's Department of Computer Science, under the guidance of Professor Rafael E. Diaz Escamilla from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at CSUS. Their collective efforts have enhanced SAVIS, ensuring it remains an effective resource for statistical education.",

Enter Data<br>There are two ways to enter the data into the Dot Plot tool. The first way is to directly type the data into the box that says “Please enter data or drop column titles from the csv file here…” The data must be typed vertically in the box. To see how to enter the data, select “Example 1” or “Example 2” in the “Examples” drop-down box. The second way is to upload a CSV file by clicking on the “Upload Data File” button. It is important to note that in the CSV file, each data point should be in different rows under the same column. When the data file is uploaded, click on the “Load Data” button. After loading the data, the dot plot will be generated automatically. Each dot represents an occurrence of a value in the dataset, allowing users to easily see patterns, clusters, and gaps in the data.<br><br>The Dot Plot also provides summary statistics including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.
