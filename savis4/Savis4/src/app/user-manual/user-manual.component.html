      <div class="green-box">
        <p>
          The One Proportion Hypothesis Test tool simulates repeated trials of coin flips to help visualize how sample proportions behave under a given probability. 
          Users can adjust the number of tosses, the number of samples drawn, and the assumed probability of heads. 
          This helps demonstrate the binomial distribution and understand whether observed proportions deviate significantly from what's expected under a given hypothesis. <br> <br>
          To use the tool, begin by setting the probability of heads (p), then choose how many coin tosses will occur in each sample. After entering the number of samples to add, click Draw Samples to simulate. 
          The resulting bar chart shows the number of heads in each trial across all samples. Red bars indicate observed frequencies, blue dots represent the theoretical binomial distribution, and green bars highlight selected intervals for custom analysis. <br> <br>
          The left sidebar provides statistics including total number of samples, average number of heads, and standard deviation. You can also use sliders to focus on a specific interval of head counts—this lets you determine what proportion of your samples fall within a chosen range. 
          This feature is especially useful for hypothesis testing scenarios where you're checking for values that are too extreme under the null hypothesis.

      <div class="green-box">
        <p>
          The Two Proportion Hypothesis Test tool helps you simulate and analyze the difference in success rates between two groups. 
          Users enter the number of successes and failures for Group A and Group B. The tool calculates the proportions and the 
          difference between them. <br><br>
          Make sure to always click "Load Data" after entering data. After loading the data, you can simulate random reallocations of success outcomes between the groups to build a sampling 
          distribution. This helps visualize how often differences as extreme as the original would occur by chance. <br><br>
          The third section displays the sampling distribution of the differences in proportions. You can adjust the minimum and 
          maximum bounds to focus on a specific range and evaluate how frequently extreme values appear. This is useful for understanding 
          statistical significance and evaluating the null hypothesis that the two proportions are equal.

          The Bar Chart tool helps to visually compare and organize data. There are two ways to use the Bar Chart tool. <br><br>
          The first way is to directly type the data into the box that says “Please enter data or drop column titles from CSV file here”. 
          It is also important to note that the data must be entered vertically. For example, do not enter multiple data points next to 
          each other. Instead, after typing a data point, press enter to type the next data point on a new row. After typing all the data 
          points, click on the “Load Data” button.<br><br>
          The second way is to upload a CSV file. To do this, click on the “Upload Data File” button. The user’s file folder in their computer 
          should pop up. From here, double click on a CSV file. It is also important to note that in the CSV file, each data point should be in 
          different rows under the same column. After double clicking on the CSV file, the data points in the chosen CSV file should appear on 
          the box that says “Please enter data or drop column titles from CSV file here”. Then, click on the “Load Data” button.<br><br>
          The x-axis of the bar chart represents the data points that the user entered. The y-axis of the bar chart represents the proportion, 
          which is the number of times a specific data point appears by the total number of the data points there are in the data. After uploading 
          the data, there is a frequency table next to the bar chart, which gives more information about the data in terms of frequency.<br><br>
          Lastly, there is a Draw Sample section under the Bar Chart. Users can type the number they would like for the sample size. Users can also 
          click on the up or down arrow in the box to increase or decrease the number for the sample size. After entering a number in the sample size
          box, click on the “Run Simulation” button. This makes new samples based on the sample size given using the data points from the bar chart that 
          the user entered.
